## 🧠 Overview
Dreamlytics is a full-stack application designed to help users analyze, journal, and reflect on their dreams using state-of-the-art AI models. Built with Nuxt 3, Capacitor, and MongoDB, it offers a seamless experience on both web and mobile platforms. The backend leverages Nuxt API routes and integrates with OpenRouter for advanced language model capabilities.

Dreamlytics provides a secure, private dream journal, advanced analytics, and a public feed for community sharing. The platform uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze dream content, extract motifs and emotions, and visualize patterns over time. Admin tools help maintain data quality and provide insights for further development.
